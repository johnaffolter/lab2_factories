## System Overview

### What This System Does
The email classification system takes an email (subject + body) and automatically categorizes it into topics like "work", "personal", "promotion", etc. It uses machine learning principles but with a simplified, educational approach.

### Key Components
```

## Factory Pattern Explained

### What is the Factory Pattern?
The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their exact classes. Think of it like a restaurant kitchen where the head chef (factory) delegates specific dishes (features) to specialized chefs (generators).

### Implementation in Our System

```python
# app/features/factory.py
class FeatureGeneratorFactory:
    """The 'Factory' that creates feature generators"""

    def __init__(self):
        # Registry of available generators
        self._generators = {
            "spam": SpamFeatureGenerator,
            "word_length": AverageWordLengthFeatureGenerator,
            "email_embeddings": EmailEmbeddingsFeatureGenerator,
            "raw_email": RawEmailFeatureGenerator,
            "non_text": NonTextCharacterFeatureGenerator  # Our addition
        }
```

### Why Use Factory Pattern Here?
1. **Extensibility**: New feature generators can be added without modifying existing code
2. **Decoupling**: The main code doesn't need to know about specific generator implementations
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each generator focuses on one type of feature extraction
4. **Testing**: Each generator can be tested independently

### Real-World Analogy
Imagine a car factory:
- **Factory** = FeatureGeneratorFactory
- **Car Models** = Different Feature Generators (Spam, WordLength, etc.)
- **Assembly Line** = generate_all_features() method
- **Final Product** = Complete feature set for classification

## Feature Generators Deep Dive

### 1. SpamFeatureGenerator
**Purpose**: Detects if email contains spam-like words

```python
def generate_features(self, email: Email) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    spam_words = ['free', 'winner', 'congratulations', 'click here']
    all_text = f"{email.subject} {email.body}".lower()
    has_spam_words = int(any(word in all_text for word in spam_words))
    return {"has_spam_words": has_spam_words}
```

**How it works**:
- Combines subject and body text
- Checks for presence of predefined spam words
- Returns binary indicator (0 or 1)

**Example**:
- Input: "Congratulations! You're a winner!"
- Output: {"has_spam_words": 1}

### 2. AverageWordLengthFeatureGenerator
**Purpose**: Calculates average word length (formal emails tend to have longer words)

```python
def generate_features(self, email: Email) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    words = all_text.split()
    total_length = sum(len(word) for word in words)
    average_word_length = total_length / len(words)
    return {"average_word_length": average_word_length}
```

**How it works**:
- Splits text into words
- Calculates total character count
- Divides by word count

**Example**:
- Input: "The cat sat" (3, 3, 3 letters)
- Output: {"average_word_length": 3.0}

### 3. EmailEmbeddingsFeatureGenerator
**Purpose**: Creates a simple "embedding" based on text length

```python
def generate_features(self, email: Email) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    title_length = len(email.subject)
    detail_length = len(email.body)
    average_embedding = (title_length + detail_length) / 2
    return {"average_embedding": average_embedding}
```

**How it works**:
- Measures subject and body lengths
- Averages them for a single numeric feature
- Simulates real embeddings (which would use neural networks)

**Why this matters**: Different email types have different length patterns:
- Work emails: Often concise
- Newsletters: Usually long
- Spam: Variable but often short

### 4. RawEmailFeatureGenerator
**Purpose**: Preserves original text for other processing

```python
def generate_features(self, email: Email) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        "email_subject": email.subject,
        "email_body": email.body
    }
```

**Use case**: Needed for similarity comparison with stored emails

### 5. NonTextCharacterFeatureGenerator (Our Addition)
**Purpose**: Counts special characters (indicators of urgency or spam)

```python
def generate_features(self, email: Email) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    all_text = f"{email.subject} {email.body}"
    non_text_count = sum(1 for char in all_text
                        if not char.isalnum() and not char.isspace())
    return {"non_text_char_count": non_text_count}
```

**Example**:
- "URGENT!!!" → {"non_text_char_count": 3}
- "Hello world" → {"non_text_char_count": 0}

## Classification Algorithm

### Cosine Similarity Explained
Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors, not their magnitude. It's perfect for text comparison because it focuses on content similarity rather than length.

```
Similarity = cos(θ) = (A·B) / (|A| × |B|)
```

### Our Simplified Implementation
Instead of true cosine similarity, we use a length-based similarity:

```python
def _calculate_topic_score(self, features: Dict[str, Any], topic: str) -> float:
    # Get email "embedding" (really just average length)
    email_embedding = features.get("email_embeddings_average_embedding", 0.0)

    # Topic "embedding" is its description length
    topic_description = self.topic_data[topic]['description']
    topic_embedding = float(len(topic_description))

    # Calculate similarity using exponential decay
    distance = abs(email_embedding - topic_embedding)
    similarity = math.exp(-distance / 50.0)  # Scale factor of 50

    return similarity
```

### Why This Works (Sort Of)
- Different topics have different typical lengths
- "Work" emails are often brief
- "Newsletter" descriptions are longer
- The exponential decay creates a smooth similarity curve

### Real vs. Educational
**Real System Would Use**:
- Word2Vec or BERT embeddings
- True cosine similarity
- TF-IDF vectors
- Neural networks

**Our System Uses**:
- Length as a proxy for content
- Simplified distance metrics
- Educational clarity over accuracy

## API Architecture

### RESTful Design Principles

#### 1. Resource-Based URLs
```
GET  /topics           # Retrieve all topics
POST /topics           # Create new topic
GET  /emails           # Retrieve stored emails
POST /emails           # Store new email
POST /emails/classify  # Classify an email (action)
```

#### 2. HTTP Methods Semantics
- **GET**: Retrieve data (idempotent)
- **POST**: Create or process data
- **PUT**: Update entire resource (not used here)
- **DELETE**: Remove resource (not implemented)

#### 3. Request/Response Structure
```python
# Request Model (Pydantic)
class EmailRequest(BaseModel):
    subject: str
    body: str
    use_email_similarity: Optional[bool] = False

# Response Model
class EmailClassificationResponse(BaseModel):
    predicted_topic: str
    topic_scores: Dict[str, float]
    features: Dict[str, Any]
    available_topics: List[str]
```

### FastAPI Benefits
1. **Automatic Documentation**: Swagger UI at `/docs`
2. **Type Validation**: Pydantic models ensure data integrity
3. **Async Support**: Can handle concurrent requests
4. **CORS Handling**: Cross-origin requests for web frontends

## Code Walkthrough

### Step 1: Email Enters System
```python
# Client request
POST /emails/classify
{
  "subject": "50% Off Sale!",
  "body": "Limited time offer on all items"
}
```

### Step 2: Route Handler
```python
@router.post("/emails/classify")
async def classify_email(request: EmailRequest):
    # Create Email object
    email = Email(subject=request.subject, body=request.body)

    # Pass to inference service
    inference_service = EmailTopicInferenceService()
    result = inference_service.classify_email(email)
```

### Step 3: Feature Generation
```python
# In EmailTopicInferenceService
def classify_email(self, email: Email):
    # Generate all features
    features = self.feature_factory.generate_all_features(email)
    # features now contains all extracted features
```

### Step 4: Classification
```python
# In EmailClassifierModel
def predict(self, features: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    scores = {}
    for topic in self.topics:
        score = self._calculate_topic_score(features, topic)
        scores[topic] = score

    # Return highest scoring topic
    return max(scores, key=scores.get)
```

### Step 5: Response
```python
return {
    "predicted_topic": "promotion",  # Highest scoring
    "topic_scores": {
        "work": 0.23,
        "personal": 0.31,
        "promotion": 0.89,  # Highest score
        "newsletter": 0.67,
        "support": 0.45
    },
    "features": {/* all generated features */},
    "available_topics": ["work", "personal", ...]
}
```

## Design Pattern Benefits

### Factory Pattern Advantages
1. **New Feature Addition**: Just create new generator class
2. **No Modification**: Existing code remains untouched
3. **Testing**: Each generator tested independently
4. **Reusability**: Generators can be used in other projects

### SOLID Principles Applied
- **S**ingle Responsibility: Each generator has one job
- **O**pen/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: All generators implement same interface
- **I**nterface Segregation: Simple, focused interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Real-World Applications
This pattern is used in:
- **Scikit-learn**: Different transformers and estimators
- **TensorFlow**: Layer factories
- **Django**: Form and model factories
- **Spring Boot**: Bean factories

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Port Already in Use
```bash
# Find process using port 8000
lsof -i :8000
# Kill it
kill -9 <PID>
```

#### 2. Module Import Errors
```bash
# Ensure you're in the right directory
cd lab2_factories
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. CORS Issues (Frontend)
Solution added in our enhancement:
```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

#### 4. Classification Always Returns Same Topic
- Check if features are being generated correctly
- Verify topic_keywords.json has distinct descriptions
- Ensure similarity calculation isn't returning constants
