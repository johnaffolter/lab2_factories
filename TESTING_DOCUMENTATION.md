## 2. Dynamic Analysis System Testing

### Pivot Point Analysis

```python
# Test code executed
analyzer = DynamicEmailAnalyzer()
result = analyzer._analyze_pivot('feature_space')
```

**Results:**
```json
{
  "pivot": "feature_space",
  "timestamp": "2024-09-28T20:15:32",
  "dimensions": {
    "generator": {
      "count": 5,
      "types": ["spam", "word_length", "email_embeddings", "raw_email", "non_text"],
      "feature_counts": {
        "spam": 1,
        "word_length": 1,
        "email_embeddings": 1,
        "raw_email": 2,
        "non_text": 1
      }
    }
  },
  "metrics": {
    "variance": 0.16,
    "importance": 0.0,
    "correlation": 0.0
  }
}
```

### Composed Analysis

```python
# Test combining multiple pivot points
composed = analyzer.compose_analysis(
    ['feature_space', 'classification_space'],
    operation='intersect'
)
```

**Results:**
- Common dimensions identified: []
- Successfully composed analysis from multiple pivots
- Each pivot maintains independent analysis

### Path Traversal

```python
# Test analysis path from input to metrics
path = analyzer.traverse_analysis('email_input', 'performance_metrics')
```

**Results:**
```
Path: email_input -> feature_extraction -> classification -> confidence_scoring -> topic_assignment -> error_detection -> feedback_loop -> model_update -> performance_metrics
Length: 9 nodes
Execution time: 245ms
```

    @property
    def feature_names(self):
        return ["test_feature"]

# Add to factory
GENERATORS["test"] = TestFeatureGenerator
