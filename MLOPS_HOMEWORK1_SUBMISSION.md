---

## 1. Dynamic Topic Management

### Implementation
Created a POST `/topics` endpoint that allows runtime addition of new topics without restarting the server.

### Code Location
`app/api/routes.py` lines 80-108

### API Endpoint
```python
@router.post("/topics")
async def add_topic(request: TopicRequest):
    """Dynamically add a new topic to the topics file"""
```

### Demonstration: Adding "finance" Topic

**Before**: 8 topics (work, personal, promotion, newsletter, support, travel, education, health)

**API Call**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/topics \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "topic_name": "finance",
    "description": "Financial emails about banking, investments, stocks"
  }'
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Topic 'finance' added successfully",
  "topics": ["work", "personal", "promotion", "newsletter", "support", "travel", "education", "health", "finance"]
}
```

**After**: 9 topics available

---

## 2. Email Storage with Ground Truth

### Implementation
Created a POST `/emails` endpoint for storing training emails with optional ground truth labels.

### Code Location
`app/api/routes.py` lines 110-140

### API Endpoint
```python
@router.post("/emails")
async def store_email(request: EmailStoreRequest):
    """Store an email with optional ground truth for training"""
```

### Demonstration: Storing Training Emails

**Store Work Email with Label**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/emails \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "subject": "Q3 Budget Review Meeting",
    "body": "Please review the attached budget spreadsheet before our meeting",
    "ground_truth": "work"
  }'
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Email stored successfully",
  "email_id": 32,
  "total_emails": 32
}
```

**Current Storage**: 31+ emails with ground truth labels stored

---

## 3. Dual Classification Modes

### Implementation
Updated classifier to support two modes:
1. **Topic Similarity**: Uses cosine similarity with topic descriptions
2. **Email Similarity**: Finds most similar stored email and uses its label

### Code Location
`app/services/email_topic_inference.py`

### Mode Selection
```python
# Topic similarity mode (default)
POST /emails/classify
{
  "subject": "Meeting tomorrow",
  "body": "Let's discuss the project",
  "use_email_similarity": false
}

# Email similarity mode
POST /emails/classify
{
  "subject": "Meeting tomorrow",
  "body": "Let's discuss the project",
  "use_email_similarity": true
}
```

---

## 4. Classification Demonstrations

### Test 1: Classify Work Email (Topic Mode)
**Input**:
```json
{
  "subject": "Quarterly Business Review",
  "body": "Please join us for Q3 review discussing revenue and KPIs",
  "use_email_similarity": false
}
```

**Output**:
```json
{
  "predicted_topic": "work",
  "topic_scores": {
    "work": 0.923,
    "personal": 0.741,
    "promotion": 0.571
  },
  "features": {
    "spam_has_spam_words": 0,
    "word_length_average_word_length": 5.92,
    "email_embeddings_average_embedding": 82.0
  }
}
```

### Test 2: Classify Using Email Similarity
**Input**:
```json
{
  "subject": "Team standup meeting",
  "body": "Daily sync to discuss blockers",
  "use_email_similarity": true
}
```

**Output**:
```json
{
  "predicted_topic": "work",
  "topic_scores": {
    "similarity_score": 0.89
  },
  "matched_email_id": 31
}
```

### Test 3: New Finance Topic Classification
**Input**:
```json
{
  "subject": "Stock Portfolio Update",
  "body": "Your investments gained 5% this month",
  "use_email_similarity": false
}
```

**Output**:
```json
{
  "predicted_topic": "finance",
  "topic_scores": {
    "finance": 0.85,
    "personal": 0.72
  }
}
```
