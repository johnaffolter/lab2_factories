# Document Classification Graph: Research & Best Practices

## Executive Summary

This research document outlines best practices for building a multi-document classification system using graph databases, based on industry standards and academic research.

## 1. Why Graph Databases for Document Classification?

### Traditional Approach Limitations
- **Relational Databases**: Poor at representing complex relationships
- **Document Stores**: Lack relationship traversal capabilities
- **Vector Databases**: Focus only on similarity, miss structural relationships

### Graph Database Advantages
1. **Natural Representation**: Documents and their relationships are inherently graph-like
2. **Flexible Schema**: Easy to add new document types and relationships
3. **Pattern Matching**: Powerful queries for finding similar documents
4. **Scalability**: Efficient traversal even with millions of documents

## 2. Industry Best Practices

### A. LinkedIn's Knowledge Graph
- **Scale**: 700M+ members, billions of documents
- **Approach**: Heterogeneous graph with entities (people, companies, skills)
- **Key Innovation**: Multi-hop traversal for recommendation

### B. Google's Document Understanding
- **BERT-based Classification**: Combined with Knowledge Graph
- **Entity Linking**: Documents connected to knowledge base entities
- **Hierarchical Classification**: Multiple levels of topics

### C. Microsoft's Project Cortex
- **Document Types**: 50+ different types
- **Auto-classification**: ML models for automatic categorization
- **Knowledge Mining**: Extracts entities and relationships

## 3. Graph Schema Design for Documents

### Recommended Node Types

```cypher
// Core Nodes
(:Document {id, type, title, content, created_date, modified_date})
(:Topic {name, description, hierarchy_level})
(:Author {id, name, email, department})
(:Project {name, description, status})
(:Organization {name, type, industry})

// Classification Nodes
(:Classification {algorithm, confidence, timestamp})
(:Feature {name, value, type})

// Metadata Nodes
(:FileFormat {type, mime_type})
(:Language {code, name})
(:Version {number, changes, timestamp})
```

### Relationship Types

```cypher
// Document Relationships
(Document)-[:HAS_TOPIC]->(Topic)
(Document)-[:CREATED_BY]->(Author)
(Document)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(Project)
(Document)-[:REFERENCES]->(Document)
(Document)-[:DERIVED_FROM]->(Document)
(Document)-[:VERSION_OF]->(Document)

// Classification Relationships
(Document)-[:CLASSIFIED_AS]->(Classification)
(Classification)-[:PREDICTS]->(Topic)
(Classification)-[:USES_FEATURE]->(Feature)

// Similarity Relationships
(Document)-[:SIMILAR_TO {score}]->(Document)
(Topic)-[:RELATED_TO {weight}]->(Topic)
```

## 6. Classification Strategy

### Multi-Level Classification

```python
Level 1: Document Type (email, report, code)
Level 2: Domain (finance, HR, technical)
Level 3: Specific Topic (budget, hiring, bug-fix)
Level 4: Sentiment/Priority (urgent, informational)
```

### Feature Engineering for Documents

1. **Structural Features**
   - Document length
   - Paragraph count
   - Section headers
   - Formatting complexity

2. **Content Features**
   - TF-IDF vectors
   - Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
   - Sentence embeddings (BERT, RoBERTa)
   - Named entities

3. **Metadata Features**
   - Author profile
   - Creation time
   - File format
   - Access patterns

4. **Graph Features**
   - Node centrality
   - Clustering coefficient
   - Path lengths
   - Community detection

## 7. Query Patterns

### Essential Cypher Queries

```cypher
// Find similar documents
MATCH (d1:Document {id: $doc_id})
MATCH (d1)-[:HAS_TOPIC]->(t:Topic)<-[:HAS_TOPIC]-(d2:Document)
WHERE d1 <> d2
WITH d1, d2, COUNT(t) as shared_topics
RETURN d2, shared_topics
ORDER BY shared_topics DESC
LIMIT 10

// Document lineage
MATCH path = (d:Document {id: $doc_id})-[:DERIVED_FROM*]->(origin:Document)
RETURN path

// Topic co-occurrence
MATCH (t1:Topic)<-[:HAS_TOPIC]-(d:Document)-[:HAS_TOPIC]->(t2:Topic)
WHERE t1 <> t2
WITH t1, t2, COUNT(d) as co_occurrence
RETURN t1.name, t2.name, co_occurrence
ORDER BY co_occurrence DESC

// Author expertise
MATCH (a:Author)-[:CREATED]->(d:Document)-[:HAS_TOPIC]->(t:Topic)
WITH a, t, COUNT(d) as doc_count
RETURN a.name, t.name, doc_count
ORDER BY doc_count DESC
```

---

## 8. Performance Optimization

### Indexing Strategy
```cypher
CREATE INDEX doc_type_idx FOR (d:Document) ON (d.type)
CREATE INDEX doc_date_idx FOR (d:Document) ON (d.created_date)
CREATE INDEX topic_name_idx FOR (t:Topic) ON (t.name)
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX doc_content_idx FOR (d:Document) ON (d.content)
```

### Caching Strategy
- **L1 Cache**: Frequently accessed documents (Redis)
- **L2 Cache**: Classification results (Memcached)
- **L3 Cache**: Graph traversal results (Application-level)

### Batch Processing
- Use `UNWIND` for bulk inserts
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Async processing for classification tasks

---

## 9. Machine Learning Integration

### Embedding Storage
```cypher
// Store embeddings as properties
CREATE (e:Embedding {
  document_id: $doc_id,
  model: 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2',
  vector: $embedding_vector,
  dimension: 384
})
```

### Similarity Computation
```python
# Using Neo4j Graph Data Science library
CALL gds.similarity.cosine.stream({
  data: embeddings,
  topK: 10
})
YIELD node1, node2, similarity
RETURN node1, node2, similarity
```
