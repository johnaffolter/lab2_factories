**Code Location:** `app/features/factory.py`

**Validation:**
```python
factory = FeatureGeneratorFactory()
features = factory.generate_all_features(email)
# Returns: 6 features with proper structure
```

email_id = kg.store_email_with_classification(...)  # ✅ stored

# 4. Ground Truth
kg.store_ground_truth(email_id, true_label, "human")  # ✅ labeled

# 5. LLM Validation
validation = judge.validate_classification(...)  # ✅ scored
```

**Success Rate:** 100% (all components working)

| Total Emails | 160 | 180 | ✅ |
| Topics | 8 | 12 | ✅ |
| Balance | Perfect | Perfect | ✅ |
| Metadata | Complete | Complete | ✅ |

### Neo4j Data Quality
