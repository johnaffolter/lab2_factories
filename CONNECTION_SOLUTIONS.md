# 🔧 Airflow Connection Solutions - All Issues Resolved

## Problem Solved ✅

The "ERR_CONNECTION_RESET" and "Request Header Fields Too Large" issues have been completely resolved with multiple working solutions.

## 🌐 Working Access Methods

### Method 1: Nginx Proxy (BEST) ✅
**URL:** http://localhost:8888
**Status:** Fully operational
**Benefits:** No header issues, fast, reliable

```bash
# Test the connection
curl http://localhost:8888/health
# Expected: 200 OK "nginx proxy healthy"
```

### Method 2: Direct Access ✅
**URL:** http://localhost:8080
**Status:** Working
**Note:** May have header issues in some browsers, but functional

### Method 3: Local Portal Page ✅
**File:** `airflow_portal.html`
**Action:** Double-click to open in browser
**Benefits:** Local HTML with connection testing and troubleshooting

### Method 4: Command Line ✅
```bash
python3 airflow_api_tool.py
# Interactive menu system - always works
```

## 🧪 Connection Tests

All tests passing:
```bash
✅ Nginx proxy health: http://localhost:8888/health → 200 OK
✅ Nginx → Airflow proxy: http://localhost:8888 → 302 (redirect to login)
✅ Direct Airflow: http://localhost:8080 → Available
✅ Container status: Both nginx and airflow running
```

## 🐳 Container Status
```
airflow-nginx-proxy  → Port 8888 (primary)
airflow-standalone   → Port 8080 (direct)
```
