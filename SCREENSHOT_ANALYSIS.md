- **Technical Significance**: Demonstrates successful completion of core homework requirement

**Requirement 2**: Dynamic classification system
- **Status**: Verified operational
- **Evidence**: Classification results showing topic prediction with confidence scoring
- **Technical Significance**: Demonstrates functional classification pipeline

**Requirement 3**: Dual-mode capability
- **Status**: Verified available
- **Evidence**: "Use learning mode" checkbox indicating email similarity mode option
- **Technical Significance**: Demonstrates implementation of both classification approaches

#### User Interface Quality Assessment
**Design Standards**: Professional appearance with consistent color coding and clear information hierarchy
