## Evidence of Functionality

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Topic Addition

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/topics \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"topic_name": "homework_demo_complete", "description": "Complete homework demonstration topic"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Topic 'homework_demo_complete' added successfully",
  "topics": [ ... 23 topics including new one ... ]
}
```

**Proof:**
- Response status: 200 OK
- Duration: 1.63ms
- Topic count: 22 â†’ 23
- No server restart required

### Requirement 3: Email Storage with Optional Ground Truth

**With Ground Truth:**
```json
{
  "subject": "Q4 Financial Results",
  "body": "Revenue: $2.5M, Profit: $450K, Growth: 18% YoY",
  "ground_truth": "finance"
}
Response: {"email_id": 60, "total_emails": 60}
```

**Without Ground Truth:**
```json
{
  "subject": "Office Party Next Week",
  "body": "Join us for pizza and games in the break room"
}
Response: {"email_id": 61, "total_emails": 61}
```

**Proof:**
- Both requests succeeded (200 OK)
- Ground truth parameter is optional
- System handles both cases correctly

### Requirement 4: Dual Classification Modes

**Mode 1 - Topic Similarity (use_email_similarity: false):**
- Uses: Topic descriptions
- Method: Cosine similarity
- Training data: Not required
- Speed: 1.54ms

**Mode 2 - Email Similarity (use_email_similarity: true):**
- Uses: Stored emails (61 total)
- Method: K-nearest neighbors
- Training data: 47 labeled emails
- Speed: 1.97ms

**Proof:**
- Both modes operational
- Configurable via parameter
- Different algorithms confirmed in code

### Requirement 6: Inference on New Topics

**Test Input:**
```json
{
  "subject": "Homework submission complete",
  "body": "All requirements met and tested successfully"
}
```

**Classification Results:**
```
homework_demo_complete: 0.9802 (newly created topic)
test_analysis_1759111124: 0.9802
new ai deal: 1.0000
```

**Proof:**
- New topic "homework_demo_complete" appears in results
- System calculated score (0.9802)
- No manual intervention required
