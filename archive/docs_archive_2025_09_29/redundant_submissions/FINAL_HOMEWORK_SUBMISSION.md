## Section I: Core Homework Requirements Implementation

### 1.1 Repository Forking and Setup

**Requirement**: Fork the lab2_factories repository from the provided source.

**Implementation Status**: Successfully completed. The original repository from <https://github.com/mlops-stthomas/lab2_factories> has been forked and extensively enhanced with additional functionality while maintaining compatibility with the original codebase structure.

**Technical Reasoning**: Forking provides a foundation for implementing required features while preserving the ability to track changes and maintain version control. The enhanced repository includes all original functionality plus the implemented homework requirements.

### 1.2 Dynamic Topic Management Endpoint

**Requirement**: Create an endpoint to dynamically add new topics and store them in the topics file.

**Implementation**: POST /topics endpoint implemented in `app/api/routes.py:98-126`

**Technical Architecture**:

```python
@router.post("/topics")
async def add_topic(request: TopicRequest):
    """Dynamically add a new topic to the classification system"""
```

**Request Schema**:

```json
{
  "topic_name": "string",
  "description": "string"
}
```

**Technical Reasoning**: The implementation utilizes file-based persistence for topic storage, enabling runtime modification of the classification system without requiring application restart. The endpoint validates topic uniqueness and maintains data integrity through proper error handling and atomic file operations.

**Evidence of Functionality**: The system currently maintains 13 topics (10 original plus 3 dynamically added during testing), demonstrating successful dynamic topic addition capability.

### 1.3 Email Storage with Optional Ground Truth

**Requirement**: Create an endpoint to store emails with optional ground truth labels for similarity classifier training.

**Implementation**: POST /emails endpoint implemented in `app/api/routes.py:128-157`

**Technical Architecture**:

```python
@router.post("/emails")
async def store_email(request: EmailStoreRequest):
    """Store email with optional ground truth for training purposes"""
```

**Request Schema**:

```json
{
  "subject": "string",
  "body": "string",
  "ground_truth": "string (optional)"
}
```

**Technical Reasoning**: The optional ground truth parameter enables supervised learning capabilities while accommodating unlabeled data ingestion. This design supports both training scenarios and real-world deployment where labels may not be immediately available. The implementation maintains referential integrity through sequential ID assignment and atomic file operations.

**Evidence of Functionality**: Current dataset contains 42 emails with 35 having ground truth labels (83.3% labeled), demonstrating robust storage capability for both labeled and unlabeled data.

### 1.4 Dual-Mode Classification System

**Requirement**: Update the classifier to optionally use either topic classification or email similarity-based classification.

**Implementation**: Dual classification modes implemented in `app/models/similarity_model.py`

**Technical Architecture**:

1. **Topic Similarity Mode**: Default classification using exponential decay similarity calculation
2. **Email Similarity Mode**: Jaccard similarity with stored emails containing ground truth labels

**Technical Reasoning**: The dual-mode approach provides flexibility in classification strategies. Topic similarity mode offers consistent classification based on predefined patterns, while email similarity mode leverages actual training data for more adaptive classification. The implementation includes intelligent fallback mechanisms when similarity thresholds are not met.

**Algorithm Details**:
- Topic similarity uses exponential decay function: `exp(-distance/scale)`
- Email similarity employs Jaccard coefficient: `intersection/union`
- Fallback threshold of 0.3 ensures reliable classification results

### 1.5 Dynamic Topic Creation Demonstration

**Requirement**: Demonstrate the creation of new topics.

**Implementation Evidence**: Successfully added multiple test topics during development and testing phases.

**Topics Added**:
- `test_topic_1759107444` - Homework demonstration topic
- `test_topic_1759108278` - Grading verification topic
- `test_reproducible_1759109850` - Reproducibility testing topic

**Technical Reasoning**: The demonstration validates that the dynamic topic management system functions correctly across multiple invocations and maintains persistence between application sessions.

### 1.6 Inference on New Topics Demonstration

**Requirement**: Demonstrate performing inference on newly created topics.

**Implementation Evidence**: Classification system successfully incorporates dynamically added topics into the inference pipeline without requiring system restart or reinitialization.

**Technical Reasoning**: The runtime topic loading mechanism ensures that newly added topics become immediately available for classification, demonstrating the system's dynamic adaptation capabilities.

### 1.7 Email Addition Demonstration

**Requirement**: Demonstrate adding new emails to the system.

**Implementation Evidence**: Comprehensive email storage functionality demonstrated through systematic addition of 42 emails with varying content types and ground truth labels.

**Storage Statistics**:
- Total emails: 42
- Labeled emails: 35 (83.3%)
- Unlabeled emails: 7 (16.7%)
- Ground truth categories: 9 distinct labels

**Technical Reasoning**: The diverse email dataset demonstrates the system's capability to handle various content types and maintain proper data organization for subsequent classification tasks.

### 1.8 Email-Based Inference Demonstration

**Requirement**: Demonstrate performing inference using stored email data.

**Implementation Evidence**: Email similarity mode successfully utilizes stored email data for classification decisions, with intelligent fallback to topic similarity when appropriate.

**Technical Reasoning**: The email-based inference leverages actual training data to make classification decisions, providing more context-aware results compared to purely rule-based approaches.

## Section II: Technical Implementation Details

### 2.1 Factory Pattern Architecture

**Core Implementation**: `app/features/factory.py` (360+ lines)

**Design Patterns Utilized**:
- Factory Method Pattern: Dynamic generator instantiation
- Registry Pattern: Centralized generator type management
- Strategy Pattern: Interchangeable feature extraction algorithms
- Flyweight Pattern: Efficient instance caching
- Singleton Pattern: Optional unified factory access

**Technical Reasoning**: The factory pattern implementation provides extensibility and maintainability by decoupling generator creation from client code. The registry pattern enables runtime generator registration, while the strategy pattern allows for flexible feature extraction approaches.

### 2.2 Feature Generation Pipeline

**Available Generators**: Five distinct feature generators implementing specialized extraction algorithms.

1. **SpamFeatureGenerator**: Keyword-based spam detection
2. **WordLengthFeatureGenerator**: Linguistic analysis through word statistics
3. **EmailEmbeddingsFeatureGenerator**: Semantic embedding generation
4. **RawEmailFeatureGenerator**: Direct content extraction
5. **NonTextCharacterFeatureGenerator**: Special character enumeration

**Technical Reasoning**: The diverse generator set ensures comprehensive feature extraction across multiple dimensions of email content, providing rich input for the classification algorithms.

### 2.3 API Architecture

**Core Endpoints**:
- `GET /features` - Feature generator metadata retrieval
- `GET /topics` - Available topic enumeration
- `POST /topics` - Dynamic topic addition
- `GET /emails` - Stored email retrieval
- `POST /emails` - Email storage with optional labeling
- `POST /emails/classify` - Dual-mode classification execution

**Technical Reasoning**: The RESTful API design follows industry standards for resource management and provides clear separation of concerns between data management and classification operations.
