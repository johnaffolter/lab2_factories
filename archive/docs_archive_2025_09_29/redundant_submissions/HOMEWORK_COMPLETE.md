```

### 4. Factory Pattern Implementation

Successfully implemented all 5 generators:

1. **SpamFeatureGenerator**
   - Detects spam keywords
   - Output: has_spam_words (0 or 1)

2. **AverageWordLengthFeatureGenerator**
   - Calculates text complexity
   - Output: average_word_length (float)

3. **EmailEmbeddingsFeatureGenerator**
   - Creates numerical representations
   - Output: average_embedding (float)

4. **RawEmailFeatureGenerator**
   - Extracts email content
   - Output: email_subject, email_body (strings)

5. **NonTextCharacterFeatureGenerator** ✨
   - **NEW: Implemented for lab assignment**
   - Counts special characters
   - Output: non_text_char_count (int)

### 5. API Endpoints

All endpoints working and tested:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| `/topics` | GET | List available topics | ✅ Working |
| `/topics` | POST | Add new topic dynamically | ✅ Working |
| `/features` | GET | List feature generators | ✅ Working |
| `/emails` | GET | Retrieve stored emails | ✅ Working |
| `/emails` | POST | Store training emails | ✅ Working |
| `/emails/classify` | POST | Classify email | ✅ Working |
| `/pipeline/info` | GET | System information | ✅ Working |

### 6. Learning System

- 31 emails stored with labels
- Learning mode uses stored emails for comparison
- Improves accuracy over time
- Ground truth preservation

## How to Run and Test

### 1. Start the System
```bash
cd lab2_factories
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 2. Open the UI
Open `frontend/enhanced_ui.html` in browser

### 3. Run Tests
```bash
python test_all_examples.py
```

### 4. Access API Docs
Visit http://localhost:8000/docs

## Files Created/Modified
